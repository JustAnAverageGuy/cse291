                User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core communication protocols of the
                Internet protocol suite used to send messages (transported as datagrams in packets) to other hosts on an
                Internet Protocol (IP) network. Within an IP network, UDP does not require prior communication to set up
                communication channels or data paths.
        </p>
        <p>
                UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. UDP
                provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at
                the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues and thus exposes the
                user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of
                delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the
                network interface level, an application may instead use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or
                Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
                UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are
                performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack.
                Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for
                packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system.

                The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in <a
                        href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc768">RFC 768</a>.

        <h3> Datagram format specification </h3>
        <p>
                A UDP datagram consists of a datagram header followed by a data section (the payload data for the
                application).<br> The UDP datagram header consists of 4 fields, each of which is 2 bytes (16 bits)
        </p>

                              User Datagram Header Format</pre>
        <h4>Fields</h4>
        <ul>
                <li>Source Port is an optional field, when meaningful, it indicates the port
                        of the sending process, and may be assumed to be the port to which a
                        reply should be addressed in the absence of any other information. If
                        not used, a value of zero is inserted.</li>
                <li>
                        Destination Port has a meaning within the context of a particular
                        internet destination address.
                </li>

                <li>
                        Length is the length in octets of this user datagram including this
                        header and the data. (This means the minimum value of the length is
                        eight.)
                </li>

                <li>
                        Checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of a
                        pseudo header of information from the IP header, the UDP header, and the
                        data, padded with zero octets at the end (if necessary) to make a
                        multiple of two octets.

                        The pseudo header conceptually prefixed to the UDP header contains the
                        source address, the destination address, the protocol, and the UDP
                        length. This information gives protection against misrouted datagrams.
                        This checksum procedure is the same as is used in TCP.
